Currently, encryption is limited to only txt files

**Planned Updates**
User able to select directory they want the generated key file to be stored in;

**DISCLAIMER**
This was just a quick project I put together in order to have some creative fun, help improve my skills with python and my skills as a programmer as a whole.
I will improve it over time as I see fit but by no means do I view this project as perfect or finished.
